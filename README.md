Modern Application Development I
Project Statement
Quiz Master - V1
It is a multi-user app (one requires an administrator and other users) that acts as an exam preparation site for multiple courses.

Frameworks to be used
These are the mandatory frameworks on which the project has to be built.


Flask for application back-end
Jinja2 templating, HTML, CSS and Bootstraps for application front-end
SQLite for database (No other database is permitted)
Note: All demos should be possible on your local machine.

Roles
The platform will have two roles:

There is only one admin to this application
The administrator login redirects to the quiz master/admin dashboard

Terminologies

Subject: The field of study in which the user wishes to give the quiz. The admin will be creating one or many subjects in the application. Every subject can possibly have the following fields:


id - primary key
Name

etc: Additional fields (if any)

Chapter: Each subject can be subdivided into multiple modules called chapters. The possible fields of a chapter can be the following:

id - primary key
Name
Description
etc: Additional fields (if any)

Quiz: A quiz is a test that is used to evaluate the user’s understanding of any particular chapter of any particular subject. A test may contain the following attributes:


id - primary key
chapter_id (foreign key-chapter)
date_of_quiz
time_duration(hh:mm)
remarks (if any)
etc: Additional fields (if any)
Questions: Every quiz will have a set of questions created by the admin. Possible fields for a question include:

Application Wireframe
Quiz Master

 


Note:
The provided wireframe is intended only to illustrate the application's flow and demonstrate what should appear when a user navigates between pages.

Replication of the exact views is NOT mandatory.
Students are encouraged to work on their own front-end ideas and designs while maintaining the application's intended functionality and flow.
Core Functionalities
Admin login and User login

A login/register form with fields like username, password etc. for user and admin login
You can either use a proper login framework or just use a simple HTML form with username and password (we are not concerned with how secure the login or the app is)
The app must have a suitable model to store and differentiate all types of users
Admin Dashboard - for the Admin

The admin should be added, whenever a new database is created
The admin creates/edits/deletes a subject
The admin creates/edits/deletes a chapter under the subject
The admin will create a new quiz under a chapter
Each quiz contains a set of questions (MCQ - only one option correct)
The admin can search the users/subjects/quizzes
Shows the summary charts

Quiz management - for the Admin

Edit/delete a quiz
The admin specifies the date and duration(HH: MM) of the quiz
The admin creates/edits/deletes the MCQ (only one option correct) questions inside the specific quiz

User dashboard - for the User

The user can attempt any quiz of his/her interest
Every quiz has a timer (timer is optional)
Each quiz score is recorded
The earlier quiz attempts are shown
Shows the summary charts
Note: The database must be created programmatically (via table creation or model code). Manual database creation, such as using DB Browser for SQLite, is NOT allowed.

Recommended Functionalities
API resources are created to interact with the subjects, chapters and/or quizzes. (Please note: you can choose which API resources to make from the given ones, It is NOT mandatory to create API resources for CRUD of all the components)
APIs can either be created by returning JSON from a controller or using a flask extension like flask_restful
External APIs/libraries for creating charts, e.g. Chart JS
Implementing frontend validation on all the form fields using HTML5 form validation or JavaScript
Implement backend validation within your app's controllers.


Optional Functionalities
Provide styling and aesthetics to your application by creating a beautiful and responsive front end using simple CSS or Bootstrap
Incorporate a proper login system to prevent unauthorized access to the app using Flask extensions like flask_login, flask_security etc.
Any additional feature you feel is appropriate for the application
